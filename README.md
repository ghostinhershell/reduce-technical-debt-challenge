# 🛠 Reduce Technical Debt Challenge

Welcome! This repo is part of a campaign to help contributors learn and practice responsible coding on GitHub, especially in the era of AI-generated code.

## ✨ Why This Exists

- **AI-generated code** often introduces uncertainty for maintainers.
- **Contributors** want to be responsible, but may not know what "responsible" looks like.
- **GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)** provides tools for automation, policy, and visibility.

This repo contains intentionally "messy-but-functional" starter code. Your challenge: Fork the repo, refactor the code, and submit a pull request to showcase your improvements!

## 🚩 Challenge Instructions

1. **Fork this repo.**
2. Pick a file in the [`js/`](js/copilot_example.js) or [`py/`](py/copilot_example.py) folder.
3. Refactor the code to:
   - Improve readability
   - Separate concerns
   - Add comments or documentation
   - Rename variables for clarity
   - Reduce repetition
   - **Don’t change the output!**
4. Commit your changes with a clear message (see below).
5. Open a pull request with a summary of what you improved.

### Suggested Commit Message Format

```
refactor: improve readability and structure in copilot_example.py
```

## 🧭 What to Look For

- Long, unstructured functions
- Poor naming / unclear logic
- No comments or docs
- Mixed concerns (logic + output + I/O all in one function)
- Repetitive or copy-paste code

## 📝 Guidelines

- Keep your tone positive and constructive: We're here to learn!
- Optional: Tag areas you refactored with comments like `// improved by [your-name]`
- Try out [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security) tools if you have access.
